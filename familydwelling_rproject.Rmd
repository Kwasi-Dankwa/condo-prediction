## This is a linear regression project with aim of exploring one family dwellings in NYC. My interest was piqued after listening to a conversation on hot97 fm about the NYC housing crisis and as a student currently studying methods of data analysis in regression I felt this was a useful topic for practice.

# Interpretation of One Family Attached units

* The graph shows the relationship between the size of one-family attached homes (measured in gross square feet) and their sale price in different boroughs of New York City (NYC).

General Observations:

* Positive Correlation: In all boroughs, there is a clear positive correlation between size and sale price. This means that larger homes generally sell for higher prices.
Linear Trend: The blue lines represent the best-fit lines which indicate a roughly linear relationship between size and price in each borough.


Borough-Specific Observations:

* Manhattan: Homes in Manhattan have the highest sale prices overall and the steepest slope in the line, indicating a stronger relationship between size and price compared to other boroughs.
* Brooklyn: Shows a similar trend to Manhattan, with high prices and a steep slope.
* Queens: Also shows a positive correlation, but the slope is less steep than Manhattan and Brooklyn, suggesting that price increases less dramatically with size in Queens.
Bronx: Homes in the Bronx have the lowest sale prices overall. The slope is less steep than Manhattan and Brooklyn, indicating a weaker relationship between size and price.
Staten Island: Shows a positive correlation with a moderate slope, indicating a relationship between size and price that is less pronounced than in Manhattan and Brooklyn but more so than in the Bronx.


# Linear Regression model for family dwellings in all boroughs combined
```{r}
NYC_family_attachedlm <- lm(sale_price ~ gross_square_feet, data = NYC_family_attached) 
summary(NYC_family_attachedlm)

```

Gross square feet has a strong and significant positive relationship with sale price.
However, the model explains only 21.71% of the variation, indicating that other important predictors might be useful in making predictions.

Intercept is -487130.23, with slope being 866.67 this means that for each additional square foot, the predicted sale price increases by approximately $866.67.
The p-value (<2e-16) is extremely small, indicating that the variable is highly significant.

# Linear Regression for each borough
```{r}
# Create a list of models, one for each borough
models <- NYC_family_attached %>%
  group_by(borough) %>%
  do(model = lm(sale_price ~ gross_square_feet, data = .))

```


```{r} 
install.packages('writexl')
library(writexl)

# view model summaries
results <- models %>% 
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    intercept = coef(model)[1], 
    slope = coef(model)[2], 
    r_squared = summary(model)$r.squared
  ) %>%
  select(borough, intercept, slope, r_squared)

# Write results to an Excel file
write_xlsx(results, path = "model_results.xlsx")

```

# Insights

## 1. Price per Square Foot (Slope)
Manhattan has the highest price per square foot ($3,538.98), which aligns with expectations since it's the most expensive borough.
Brooklyn comes next ($969.61), suggesting a high but significantly lower price per square foot compared to Manhattan.
Queens ($338.06), Bronx ($132.47), and Staten Island ($157.03) have much lower price increases per square foot.


## 2. Model Fit (R-Squared)
Brooklyn (0.366): Best model fit, meaning gross_square_feet explains 36.6% of the variation in sale price.
Queens (0.181), Manhattan (0.168), Staten Island (0.134), Bronx (0.065): Weaker fits, meaning other factors (like location, amenities, or building type) play a major role.

## 3. Intercept Interpretation
Brooklyn and Manhattan have large negative intercepts:
This suggests that at very low square footage values, the model predicts unrealistically negative sale prices.
This might indicate that a non-linear model (e.g., log-transformation or polynomial regression) would work better.

Further Revisits of this model will try to incorporate adding additional predictor variables to make it a multiple linear regression model

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
