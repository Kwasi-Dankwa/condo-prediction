# condo-prediction

# Information
This is a linear regression project with aim of exploring condo prices in NYC. My interest was piqued after listening to a conversation on hot97 fm about the NYC housing crisis and as a student currently studying methods of data analysis in regression I felt this was a useful topic for practice.

## Dataset

The [data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/finance/property/property-rolling-sales-data.page) used was the Department of Financeâ€™s rolling sales files list tax class 1, 2, and 4 properties that have sold in the last 12-month period in New York City in 2024. These files include the neighborhood, building type, square footage, and other data.

## Guiding Questions

The purpose of this Project is to explore the following questions:

* How Well does the Size of a Condominium in New York City Explain Sale Price?

* How well does the size of a condominium (measured in gross square feet) explain or predict sale price across New York City as a whole?

To answer this, we'll explore property sales data for all five boroughs combined.

* How well does the size of a condominium explain or predict sale price for each individual borough?
  
For this question, we'll build, analyze, and compare linear models for each borough.

Along the way, I'll also see how erroneous sale price entries influence our models, and we will devise methods to remove problematic entries.
