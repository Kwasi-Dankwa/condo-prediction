# Information
This is a linear regression project with aim of exploring condo prices in NYC. My interest was piqued after listening to a conversation on hot97 fm about the NYC housing crisis and as a student currently studying methods of data analysis in regression I felt this was a useful topic for practice.

## Guiding Questions

The purpose of this Guided Project is to explore the following questions:

* How Well does the Size of a Condominium in New York City Explain Sale Price?

* How well does the size of a condominium (measured in gross square feet) explain or predict sale price across New York City as a whole?

To answer this, we'll explore property sales data for all five boroughs combined.

* How well does the size of a condominium explain or predict sale price for each individual borough?
  
For this question, we'll build, analyze, and compare linear models for each borough.

Along the way, I'll also see how erroneous sale price entries influence our models, and we will devise methods to remove problematic entries.
